Problem Statement:
Ever contemplated the best time to book a hotel room or the optimal stay length for the best rates? What if you could predict if a hotel might receive an unusual number of special requests? Dive into this hotel booking dataset! It includes booking details for city and resort hotels, devoid of personal identifiers. Explore to uncover booking dynamics.

Project Summary:
The Hotel Bookings Analysis project delves into a real-world dataset spanning 2015 to 2017, focusing on hotel bookings from city and resort venues. The objective is to clean, analyze, manipulate, and visualize the data to extract insights into booking determinants. Here's a project outline:

1. Data Import and Cleaning:
   - Import libraries and load the hotel booking CSV into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Utilize libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis and visualization.

2. Data Exploration:
   - The dataset encompasses 119,390 rows and 32 columns with varied data types.
   - 31,944 duplicate rows are identified and removed.
   - Address null values, especially in columns like company, agent, children, and reserved_room_type.

3. Data Wrangling:
   - Identify and remove outliers from columns like lead_time, ADR, and days_in_waiting_list.
   - Create the total_stay column by combining stays_in_weekend_nights and stays_in_week_nights.
   - Develop the total_guest column using adults, children, and babies.

4. Data Visualization:
   - Employ visualizations to comprehend relationships among variables.
   - Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses using bar plots, count plots, and pie charts.

5. Correlation Analysis:
   - Conclude with a heatmap visualizing correlations among dataset variables.

By following these steps, the Hotel Bookings Analysis project endeavors to unveil crucial insights into hotel booking trends, guest demographics, and influential factors in the hospitality sector.</h3>
